# Instacart Analysis using Python
Acting as an analyst for Instacart, I'm diving into their sales data to uncover hidden patterns. My goal: refine their market segmentation strategies by conducting thorough exploratory analysis with Python. Stay tuned for insights that could redefine their approach and drive even better sales.

## Objective
In this project, I take on the role of an analyst for Instacart to explore sales patterns and customer behaviors. The goal is to unearth insights that will inform better customer segmentation and targeted marketing strategies.
## Context
Instacart, an established online grocery platform, seeks to refine its marketing efforts. They believe that a one-size-fits-all approach isn't optimal. My analysis aims to segment customers effectively and propose targeted strategies to enhance product sales.
## Key Questions
- What are the peak order times and days?
- When do customers tend to spend the most?
- How can product price ranges improve marketing strategies?
- Which product departments are most popular?
- How do customer demographics and behaviors vary in terms of brand loyalty, regional differences, and purchasing patterns?
## Data Source
The project leverages open-source datasets from Instacart, complemented by specially created customer datasets. These resources are integral to addressing the outlined business questions.

- Instacart Customers
## Folders
- 01 Project Management: Project brief and data dictionary
- 02 Data: Separated into two subfolders Original and Prepared Data. These contain the original data frames and the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively. (Data files not uploaded to GitHub due to size.)
- 03 Scripts: Jupyter notebooks containing coding for analysis
- 04 Analysis: Separated into two subfolders Reports and Visualizations. The Reports subfolder contains crosstabs and the Visualizations subfolder contains the visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.
- 05 Sent to Client: Final report presented in Excel
## Final Deliverable
For a comprehensive view of my findings and recommendations, please refer to the [Final Project Presentation](https://github.com/katiedallarosa/InstacartAnalysis-Python/blob/main/Instacart%20Grocery%20Basket%20Analysis_KDallaRosa.pdf) as well as the [Instacart Basket Analysis zip folder](https://github.com/katiedallarosa/InstacartAnalysis-Python/blob/main/04-2024%20Instacart%20Basket%20Analysis_KDallaRosa.zip) containing all data sets, graphs, and reports.

This analysis is not only about uncovering current trends but also about predicting future customer behaviors, thereby enabling Instacart to stay ahead in a competitive market.
